# Overview

I used this program to help me improve my programming  skills and to help improve my problem solving skills.

In this program, I designed it to take data from the user and store it in a vector, then I take the information that is stored in the vector and it displays the data that was stored.

I wanted to write this software to help me improve my skills with C++, I've been working on mastering certain aspects of the language and this code shows the knowledge that I've gained while working to improve my skills as a programmer.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment
the programming enviornment that I used for this project was in visual studio

As for libraries I used the string library, the vector library, iostream, as well as many other libraries that I used to structure my code.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- add more functionality to the program so the user can add more information.
- add a couple of functions so the user can input more information.
